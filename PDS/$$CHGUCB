Notes on UCB**** program changes and additions.

2012/11/19 - SBG - UCBTAPE - v1.1 :
     Sometimes tape volser fields in the general UCB areas are used
     for other purposes at different stages of a job, or at different
     stages of tape mount status.  If you catch the run of UCBTAPE
     at such times, you might get binary data in the 3 potential
     "volser" fields that we are checking.  Just to make sure we
     don't display this binary data, we scrub it by changing
     unprintables and invalid volser characters to blanks, before
     displaying.  If you feel this was done in error, where, for
     example, you might have weird volser names, and the translate
     table doesn't let those characters go through, please modify
     the table TRTBL0, and report the necessary changes to me.
