*      RELOGON  -  LOGOFF AND LOGON AGAIN TO YOUR TSO USERID          *
*                                                                     *
*   Author:   Jeffrey R. Broido                                       *
*                                                                     *
*   Reconstituted from a disassembly and fixed by:  Sam Golob         *
*                                                                     *
*   Not re-entrant.                                                   *
*                                                                     *
*   This program has been fixed for 8-character userids.              *
* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *
*   The BYE command is more general than this command.                *
* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *
*   See note about the TSB password below.... instructive.            *
* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *
*   The original intent of this program was to put the statement:     *
*                                                                     *
*   LOGON userid/password                                             *
*                                                                     *
*   into the RELOGON buffer, pointed to by the PSCBRLGB field of      *
*   the PSCB.  Also, the RELOGON switch X'10' in the ECTSWS field     *
*   of the ECT is set.                                                *
*                                                                     *
*   This has the effect that when you get out of ISPF, you            *
*   immediately LOGOFF, and execute the instructions in the RELOGON   *
*   buffer, which is LOGON userid/password .                          *
*                                                                     *
*   This is an old program, and the following is true:                *
*   The "password" part of this, only works if the userid was         *
*   defined by UADS.  When the userid was defined by RACF, this       *
*   password field is blank.  In that case, the LOGON command, set    *
*   up by RELOGON, is:                                                *
*                                                                     *
*   LOGON userid                                                      *
*                                                                     *
*   So you have to enter the password again, when you re-LOGON.       *
*   Sorry about that!  (The BYE command is more general, and it       *
*   has more power than this command.)                                *
*                                                                     *
*   HOWEVER......                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*   See member RELOGON# in this pds (CBT File 731) for more           *
*   detail.  IT IS possible to tell a RACF-defined userid to put      *
*   the password (in clear text) into the TSB (using the ZAPLWA       *
*   command - ZAPLWA P).  However you probably won't want to do       *
*   that, unless you're SURE that nobody is going to look at your     *
*   TSO session's TSB.                                                *
*                                                                     *
*   If you executed this program when in ISPF, and you haven't        *
*   been logged off yet, you can undo the forced LOGOFF by using      *
*   the non-APF-authorized TSO command called NOLOGOF, which          *
*   (I hope) is included in this pds.      (S.Golob - July 2017)      *

*     About the TSB password:  It is:  Blanks if the userid           *
*     is RACF-defined, and you'll have to re-enter it to LOGON.       *
*     But if the id is UADS-defined, then the password is inserted    *
*      automatically and is meaningful, which was the original        *
*      purpose of this command--that you shouldn't have to enter      *
*      the password again, in order to LOGON.                         *
*     You can force TSO to put the password into the TSB, by setting  *
*      bit X'10' at +X'42' (LWASPASS bit in the LWA - IKJEFLWA macro) *
*      on, and logging off and then logging on.  This works for       *
*      a RACF-defined userid.  The ZAPLWA command in CBT File 731     *
*      with option P will do this.  ZAPLWA PF will undo this.         *
