        PROGRAMS RELATING TO THE TPVT
        (TSO PARMLIB VECTOR TABLE)  :

           SHOWTPVT -  Format all the fields of the TPVT
                       (TSO PARMLIB Vector Table) which is
                       not documented publicly by IBM.  This
                       program will display and explain all
                       the fields in this control blok on
                       your system.

           ADIS     -  Display all the TSO Authorization tables
                       that were generated by the IKJTSOxx
                       PARMLIB settings.

           ALPL     -  Display or (if APF-authorized) change
                       the default TSO allocations to OLD or
                       SHR, without using or changing the
                       PARMLIB setting.

           INMXD    -  Display and format all of the fields
                       in the INMXPARM (SEND) control block
                       pointed to by the TPVT.

           CINMX    -  Change the XMIT output limit (OUTLIM)
                       or the warning interval, or the start
                       point for the warnings, without using
                       or changing the PARMLIB setting.

           DTEST    -  Display the in-storage PARMLIB TEST
                       parameter values (hooked off the TPVT).

           EESCB    -  Display the in-storage SEND parameter
                       values and Broadcast Dataset parameters
                       in great detail.

           DVAT     -  Display the VATLST settings which have
                       remained in storage after the IPL.
                       (Some of them are only in storage at
                       IPL time and they disappear afterwards.)

           LOADTEST -  This program is meant to be run as a batch
                       program, APF authorized when it is used to
                       reload the TEST parameters from TESTIN
                       card input, or when regressing to a
                       previous TPT control block using PARM=R.

           LOGOPTS  -  Display or (if APF-authorized) change
                       the IKJTSOxx LOGON option settings,
                       in storage, without affectng PARMLIB.
                       The real switch is in the TSVT, but
                       there is a copy in the TPVT that does
                       not do anything--just reflects the other
                       switch.  This program changes both.

        PROGRAMS RELATING TO THE TSO RELOGON BUFFER:

           SHOWRLGB -  Displays the entire contents of the TSO
                       Relogon buffer, and all its settings.

           BYE      -  Allows you to enter any command in the
                       TSO Relogon buffer, or to reset it
                       (i.e. re-initialize it).

           YESLOGOF -  Set the ECTLOGF flag ON in the ECT, so
                       that the command in the Relogon buffer
                       is executed at LOGOFF time.  TSO cmd.

           NOLOGOF  -  Set the ECTLOGF flag OFF in the ECT...
                       (Opposite action to YESLOGOF command)

           RELOGON  -  Program from Jeff Broido, to execute
                       a re-logon from native TSO.  From ISPF
                       it works differently, but may be useful
                       sometimes.

        PROGRAMS RELATING TO 8-CHARACTER USERID TESTING:

           TSVT8    -  APF-authorized command for z/OS 2.3 and
                       higher, to switch 8-character TSO userid
                       capability ON or OFF.

           CPFX     -  TSO command to change your TSO prefix
                       according to 8-character userid rules.
                       (downward compatible too)

           ALLIDS   -  TSO command to display your own userid
                       which is present in many different
                       control blocks.  8-character userid
                       compatible.  If there is some anomaly
                       in your TSO address space, with some
                       userids different from others, you can
                       find it with this command.

        MISCELLANEOUS USEFUL TSO COMMANDS:

           DACEE    -  Display and formats your own address
                       space's ACEE, including a hex display
