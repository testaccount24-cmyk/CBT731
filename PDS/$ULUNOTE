Notes on the ULUT accessing method to scan UCB's.

      Programs:  UCBDASD, UCBTAPE, UCBTYPE.

Introduction.

Gilbert Saint-flour discovered this IBM internal technique for doing
non-authorized scans of REAL UCB's.  IBM keeps a real UCB Lookup Table
(called the ULUT), in above-the-bar storage (64-bit addressability).
Previously, it was in above-the-line storage.  The format of this
table is not guaranteed.  IBM can change the format at will, but they
have established "types" (or formats) of ULUT table.  Currently, as
of this writing, there are three ULUT types, type X'01' and type X'02',
and type X'03'.  The type 3 ULUT information, starting with z/OS 2.2,
now resides in 64-bit storage, and 64-bit techniques are needed for
its access.

The advantage of using this "direct lookup" technique to access the
real UCB's and not a copy, is that a non-authorized program can do it.
If you need to SERIALIZE the real UCB or its extensions, in order to
update it, then you need authorization.  But JUST TO READ the contents
of the UCB's, and you want "real time" information without having to be
authorized, then this is the method of access to use.

Up through the z/OS 2.1 level, if you want to check the format of the
ULUT, you first look for which "type" it is, and then you know what to
do.  You do not have to check the system level.  Knowing the ULUT TYPE
is enough.  From z/OS 2.2 and beyond, since the ULUT is now in 64-bit
storage, and 64-bit techniques are needed to access the ULUT, you need
to check the system level to see if it is at least z/OS 2.2, and for
that level and above, you need to code 64-bit access mode instructions.

The ULUT type 1 has existed at least as far back as ESA 5.2.2 which
is pre-Y2K.  The ULUT type 2 has extended as far forward as z/OS 2.1.
The switch from type 1 to type 2 occurred at z/OS 1.7.

At the z/OS 2.2 level, ULUT is type 3, and the ULUT control block has
been moved into 64-bit storage.  So from z/OS 2.2 onward, you need to
use 64-bit mode instructions (SAM64) to access the ULUT data.  But the
UCB data, once accessed, is in 31-bit format, so the old methods of
access can be used against that data.  You first have to move the
UCB address from its location in 64-bit storage (in the ULUT control
block) into 31-bit storage, and then all the old methods will suffice.

The ULUT consists of two parts.  First is a bunch of fields containing
general quantities, such as the total number of entries in the table,
and the number of entries in each device category, such as DASD, TAPE,
and so forth.  After that, there is the device table itself, describing
all the devices.  We will refer to the device table itself as the table
of entries, or the ULUT table entries (described by ULUE).

For all ULUT types thus far, the format of the 12-byte ULUT table
entries (ULUE) appears to be the same.

   ULUT table entries are 12 bytes in length. No change in format.

     The first halfword is the unit number in hex.
     The second halfword consists of flags.
     The third halfword is a sequence counter number in the table.
     The fourth halfword is probably unused for now.
     The next fullword contains the real UCB address of the unit.

     Example:

          0A80 4000 010D 0000 00F511D0

          unit flag coun-     real UCB
          addr      ter       address

In order to read the ULUT table entries, you look at the first
halfword of the table entry which is the hex device address, and the
last fullword of the ULUT table entry, which points to the real UCB.

The UCB itself, contains, or points to, related areas that tell you
just about anything you need to know about that particular device.
So the main guts of each ULUT table entry is the hex device number,
and the address of the real UCB which defines that device.

For ULUT type 1 and type 2, the general ULUT control block itself is
accessed by the following instructions, which have to execute in
31-bit mode (AMODE 31).  We have condensed this sequence of
instructions into a relatively easy-to-use macro, called ULUINIT.  We
will explain more about our ULUINIT macro later.  For now, here are
the instructions that are used to get the address of the entire ULUT
table, and to afterwards point to the address of the first 12-byte
ULUT table entry.

The rest of this discussion concerns the ULUINIT and ULUSCAN macros,
which I invented so that using this coding method should become nearly
as easy as coding a UCBSCAN macro from IBM.   (See CBT File 873)

As of this writing, I have not yet updated these macros to accommodate
ULUT type 3 (64-bit ULUT).

   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

I invented the ULUDSECT control block for the purpose of simplifying
the process of reading through all the devices defined in the UCB
Lookup Table.  Instead of looking at the UCB itself and extracting
any fields we want to look at, our ULUSCAN macro pre-extracts commonly
used fields from the UCB and related control blocks, in one process,
putting all this information into the ULUDSECT control block.  Then,
most subsequent inquiries from the UCB actually go to ULUDSECT fields,
which were obtained from the UCB by the ULUSCAN macro's action.  To
put it another way, we might say that the ULUSCAN macro "pre-digests"
the UCB information, before we make our inquiries.

The ULUINIT macro requires a 64-byte workarea, which contains the
control block described by the ULUDSECT macro.  The fields of the
ULUDSECT control block are actually filled by two macros:  ULUINIT
initially, and then ULUSCAN later.  The ULUINIT macro is executed
once, to establish the ULUDSECT control block and to fill in its fields
relating to the whole ULUT control block itself.  The ULUSCAN macro
then reads each individual 12-byte ULUT table entry corresponding to
each individual device, "pre-digesting" its UCB fields and placing
them into the ULUDSECT control block.

The ULUSCAN macro is therefore executed repeatedly, one time for each
device defined in that system.

The contents of the ULUDSECT control block follows below.

To be clearer, the ULUINIT macro establishes the ULUDSECT control block
and fills in those fields NOT having to do with each UCB, but with the
ULUT control block in general.  The ULUSCAN macro then fills in all
ULUDSECT fields which have to do with each ULUT table entry (that is,
each particular UCB).

You can see that everything necessary to describe a device (i.e. a
UCB) can be obtained from the contents of ONE ULUDSECT entry.  To
scan all the UCB's on a system, you run the ULUSCAN macro to step
through the ULUT table entries, one at a time, pre-digesting each
one's UCB information and putting it into the ULUDSECT control block.

APF-authorization is not necessary to do this, but the scan must be
done in 31-bit mode.  Here is what the ULUDSECT control block looks
like.

Now I have to show you how to use our ULUT access macros, ULUINIT
and ULUSCAN.  A complete coding example is included in this pds.
This is the TSO command called ULUDIAG.  The TSO command ULUDIAG
will display all relevant ULUDSECT fields for each defined UCB (ULUT
table entry).  Here is an example of ULUDIAG output:  The output was
produced by the coding example below it, with the print lines being
done by means of the PUTENTRY subroutine.

MECHANISM OF OPERATION:

The ULUDSECT control block contains (or has access to) all the
information that you'll need about one particular device.  The
fields of the ULUDSECT control block are filled by:

1.  The ULUINIT macro, which creates the ULUDSECT control block
    and fills those of its fields common to the entire ULUT
    control block.

2.  The ULUSCAN macro, which fills in all fields in the ULUDSECT
    having to do with ONE UCB, pointed to by ONE ULUT table entry.

After you invoke the ULUINIT macro once, you then invoke the ULUSCAN
macro repeatedly.  Each invocation of the ULUSCAN macro gives you
information about ONE device, represented by ONE UCB, pointed to
by ONE 12-byte ULUT table entry.

The above code works by doing a complete search of ALL defined
devices.  It "marches" completely through the entire ULUT table,
from beginning to end.  Each invocation of the ULUSCAN macro gives
information from ONE ULUT table entry, which points to ONE UCB,
that represents ONE device.

Each time the ULUSCAN macro is invoked, it fills the fields of the
ULUDSECT control block with a lot of information extracted from, or
derived from, that UCB.  You can picture this situation by saying that
the ULUSCAN macro "pre-digests" information from each UCB, putting
the "digested" information into the ULUDSECT control block.

To step through the ULUT (UCB Lookup Table), from one entry to the
next, just move the ULUDNEXT field (pointing to the NEXT ULUT table
entry) into the ULUDCURR field (meaning the current ULUT table entry)
and reinvoke the ULUSCAN macro, to refill all the ULUDSECT fields for
the next UCB.  Then your program will go process the new UCB's
information.  Do this until you've reached the end of the ULUT table.

Where is the end of the table?  It is found by COUNTING.

The total number of entries in the ULUT table, extracted from a field
in the ULUT control block, is loaded into the BREG register by the
ULUINIT macro.  This register can be used later as a BCT register to
count through all the table entries, that exact number of times.  The
ULUSCAN macro does not automatically do a partial search, as yet,
like IBM's UCBSCAN macro can do.  (UCBSCAN does all the selections
under the covers, but in reality, it also does a complete search of
all UCB's, much of the time).

Selection of devices, for example, only those which are online, is
done while that device's ULUT table entry is being processed by the
ULUSCAN macro.  The ULUSCAN macro loads that device's UCB information
into the fields of the ULUDSECT control block, and the selection is
usually done by looking somewhere in the ULUDSECT control block, and
by making a selection decision from one of its fields.

For example, to see if a device is online, the ULUDONLF field, which
the ULUSCAN macro extracts from that device's UCB+3, is examined for
the X'80' bit.  If that bit is on, then the device is online.  If
not, then the device is offline.  All other selection criteria are
done, using fields created from that unit's UCB, and which have
already been loaded into the ULUDSECT control block by the ULUSCAN
macro.  Then, when you've finished with that particular UCB, you loop
back to the next ULUT table entry and invoke the ULUSCAN macro again,
to get information from the next UCB.  ULUSCAN refills the ULUDSECT
control block with new information from the next device's UCB (the
next ULUT table entry).  Then you look at that one.  And so on, until
you've searched through the entire ULUT table, and you've seen all
the defined devices.

The advantage of doing all of this, is that you can do a complete
scan of all the real UCB's, without having to be APF-authorized.
