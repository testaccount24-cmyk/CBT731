)F FUNCTION -

 Globally change the in-storage values for the TSO ALLOCATE (ALLOC)
  command, to default to OLD or to SHR.

 Also, to DISPLAY the current default setting for the TSO ALLOCATE
  command, whether it is OLD or SHR.  The DISPLAY function of ALPL
  does not have to run APF authorized.

  The ALPL TSO command is an APF authorized TSO command to change
    the default disposition of a dataset allocated by the TSO/E
    ALLOC command if the disposition (OLD or SHR) is not explicitly
    mentioned in the ALLOCATE command.  Usually the default is
    OLD, but you can change it to SHR with a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx)
    or SET IKJTSO=xx PARMLIB switch.  The ALPL command is useful
    when you want to do the change "on the fly" and "on the sly"
    if you don't have the option of doing the PARMLIB switch, for
    some reason.  (For example, if management won't allow a
    PARMLIB change.)

    If no parameter is entered after ALPL, then the current
    status of the ALLOC command default is displayed.  The display
    function of ALPL does not need APF authorization.

    Valid other operands are SHR or OLD.  If these operands
    do not cause a change in status, then a message is issued
    and no change is done.  APF Authorization of the TSO command
    is only needed if a change will be done.

    Changes are done directly (in Key 0) to the IKJALPL control
    block in common storage, and are valid until the next PARMLIB
    UPDATE(xx), SET IKJTSO=xx, or IPL.  The values entered apply
    to the entire LPAR, and all the users of that MVS instance
    (SO BE CAREFUL).

    The TSO PUTLINE interface is used, so you can print or SYSOUTTRAP
    the output of the ALPL TSO command.

    NON-REENTRANT, NON-REUSABLE.

)X SYNTAX  -
    ALPL                 (displays current setting OLD or SHR)
      or
    ALPL OLD             (changes ALLOC setting to OLD if different)
      or
    ALPL SHR             (changes ALLOC setting to SHR if different)


  DEFAULT  - NONE
  ALIAS    -
  NOTE     - The ALPL command is supported for previous releases
             of TSO/E, and has been tested on MVS releases back to
             MVS/ESA 5.2.2 and forward to z/OS 1.13.

)O OPERANDS -
)) *none*    -  A display of the current default setting for the
                ALLOC command is shown.

))OLD        -  If the current setting is SHR, it will be switched
                to OLD.  Otherwise, it will be kept the same.

))SHR        -  If the current setting is OLD, it will be switched
                to SHR.  Otherwise, it will be kept the same.
