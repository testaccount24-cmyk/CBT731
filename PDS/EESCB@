)F FUNCTION -
  The EESCB TSO command is a means of displaying the status
    of the BROADCAST dataset on an MVS system, and displaying
    whether a BROADCAST switch was done, when, and by whom.

    EESCB is an effective replacement for the D IKJTSO,SEND
    Operator command, and it is useful when you don't have
    access to an image of a system console.

    The EESCB command uses the PUTLINE interface for displaying
    its output, so its output may be captured with SYSOUTTRAP.

    The EESCB command will work with older releases of TSO/E
    (before Release 3, or with z/OS 1.2 and back to ESA 5.2.2)
    but will show whatever control block information was relevant
    at those levels.  Broadcast Dataset switching was introduced
    with z/OS 1.3, or TSO/E Release 3.

             dataset switching, from TSO/E Release 3 and upward.
