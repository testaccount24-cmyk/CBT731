   especially LOGON date and time.  This command can display
   information that is not usually available to "display user"
   type TSO commands.

                     TSU INFORMATION - V1.5
                     ---------------   ----
  USERID    ASID  LOGON DATE-TIME  PROCEDURE TERMID   STLB T ROW COL

  Explanations:

  All the TSO sessions will be displayed, and sorted in
  ASID order.  Most of the fields are self-explanatory,
  except for STLB.  STLB (if non-zero) indicates that one
  or more of the TSO authorization tables, have been loaded
  from the IKJTABLS module in an APF-authorized STEPLIB,
  instead of being copied from the IKJTSOxx PARMLIB member.
  This points out (more or less) "privileged" TSO userids.
  "STLB" stands for "STepLib-Based".

  The column "T" shows whether the TSO session is RACF-based
  or "R", or if is UADS-based, or "U".  A session which is
  "Starting" is marked "S".  "T" stands for "session Type".

  As of TSUINFO 1.5, the terminal size of each TSU is marked,
  in ROWS and COLS.

  LOGON times come from each userid's PSCB.  They are not
  dependent on SMF records.
